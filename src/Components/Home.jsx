      >Hi, my name is Shay. I am a software developer with a background in education. When I was teaching I got involved with implementing new technology platforms into the classroom, and that is where I discovered my love of coding. I love to take on new projects or fix things that are not working in others. It is like a giant puzzle to me, and I love figuring them out and learning new things.   </div>
